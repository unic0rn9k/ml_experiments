The idea of this exercise is to create a minimal subset language of English. Next I will need a similar, or larger sized list of nouns. Here it is important that the nouns can convey a large variation of "props" (weapon, blade, cicle) or characters (dragon, hero, trader, merchant), phenomenons (eg. illness, party), concepts (eg. analogy, reference, concept, process), emotions (happiness, sorrow) and generic objects that are common in the physical world (eg. plant, animal, table, vehicle). Feel free to use my examples.
